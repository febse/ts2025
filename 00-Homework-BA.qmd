# Presentation (Business Administration) {.unnumbered}

As we discussed in class, I have created a GitHub Repository with a sample
presentation in Quarto format. To download the repository in one go, you can
clone it using R-Studio (you need to have Git installed on your computer, look in @sec-software-setup for instructions)

1. Open R-Studio
2. Go to File -\> New Project
3. Select Version Control
4. Select Git
5. Paste the URL of the repository in the Repository URL field

:::{.callout-note}
## Repository URL

<https://github.com/febse/econ2025-presentation.git>
:::

6. Select a local directory where you want to save the repository
7. Click on Create Project
8. Wait for R-Studio to clone the repository and open the project
9. Open the file `presentation.qmd` in the editor
10. Click on the Render button in the upper right corner of the editor
11. The presentation will be generated in powerpoint format and saved in the same directory as the `presentation.qmd` file
12. Open the presentation in PowerPoint and edit it as you like

## Image and Tables

If you encounter difficulties with the images and tables in the presentation, you can always 
just run the code in R-Studio and copy the output into PowerPoint.

The sample code saves the two figures as `.png` files in the same directory as the `presentation.qmd` file, so
you can import them into PowerPoint.

## Your Own Presentation

1. Choose the data for you own presentation
2. Save the CSV or Excel file in the same directory as the `presentation.qmd` file
3. Change the file name in the calls to `read_csv` or `read_excel` in the `presentation.qmd` file
4. Change the code in the `presentation.qmd` file to generate the plots and tables you want to include in your presentation
